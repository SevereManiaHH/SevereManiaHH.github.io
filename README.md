## Tickle Torture

Even while laughter is typically a pleasant and desired response when it is elicited by tickling, it can also cause acute and severe stress because laughter is an inescapable emotion, whether it is enjoyable or not. Whether they want to or not, the person getting tickled laughs whether or not they find the encounter enjoyable. Laughter in these situations may signal a panic attack instead than a pleasure reaction.

Tickling that is forced can be rather upsetting, mentally and physically. When someone is tickled, they lose all control over their body and experience tension, exhaustion, and anxiety. It can therefore sometimes result in a horrible death, even though it may not appear as threatening as being physically abused with punches or using a particular machine meant to enhance suffering.

In her book A to Z of Punishment and Torture, scholar Irene Thompson offered one of the most well-known criticisms of this particular practice. Known as "Chinese tickling torture," this was a common practice during the Han Dynasty (206-220 AD). It was used as a covert form of retribution against criminals and traitors since it usually left no marks and allowed the victim to heal completely. It is believed that this treatment has been used at other occasions, even though there is no thorough register to identify situations when it resulted in death. Actually, this is an uncommon result. According to Mark Schreiber, a different researcher and analyst, people in Japan used to tickle criminals "mercilessly."
